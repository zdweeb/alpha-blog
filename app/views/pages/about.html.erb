          <h4>About</h4>
          
            <p>William has been a Software Engineer since 1998 cutting his teeth on Microsoft Visula Basic 6 in Syracuse, New York. 
          In 1999 William moved to Rochester, New York to take a position with Kodak as a Visual Basic 6 tools developer
          supporting Embedded Engineers working on the Digital press 'Nexpress'. It was durning his 4 year tenure he fell in
          love with Python and subsequently the web application framework Zope, (hence his alias @zdweeb). After four years and one trip 
          to Heidelburg, Germany, to deploy his flagship app 'ACOT - Assembly Checkout Tool' he was laid off.</p>
          
          <h4>Moving out West</h4>
          <p>Being self taught William had difficulty finding a job post 9/11, convinced he needed a BS in CS he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah
          to attend newly opended private school 'Neumont University'. It was there in 2005 William found Ruby and Ruby on Rails
          and in its infancy he developed capstone projects each semester in this obscure platform. The school was teaching c# and Java, in 
          which William did well. After graduation in 2007 William took a startup job which lasted 8 months then later found a job using Python and django.
          Once again laid off William fell ill in 2009 after the death of his Father.</p>
          
          <h4>Moving back East</h4>
          <p>Recovering in 2010 William found
          his way back to Rochester, New York and working for Xerox with his beloved Ruby and Rails. This time supporting the PhD's,
          developing complex financial predicting algorythms by building prototype apps in Flex with Rails backend. He was also introduced
          to Hadoop. With a family illness in 2011 William opted to leave Xerox to work at home for a startup developing a self publishing
          platform in Rails. After 9 months William's illness returned. It is now, after 4 years of not coding William is using 
          the excellent courses at Udemy to gain his confidence to return to the workforce once again with skills in Ruby, Rails
          and iOS.</p>
